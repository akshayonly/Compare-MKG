- This web application Visualise & Compare Any Two Research (Scientific) Topics Based On MeSH Terms.
- Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) are NLM-controlled vocabulary given to research articles for indexing and recommendation of research articles.
- Given any two research (scientific) topics, this site would search relevant PubMed research articles related to both topics.
- The MeSH terms from all selected research articles from both topics are then projected (visualized) as Network Graph.
- The goal here is to visualize what terms are encompassed in the user-given research topics and which of them are share common terms.

## Objective
Researching about a topic is a tedious process when most of the time is spent on searching articles and figuring out which one to invest further time upon to read. This is a small demonstration for visualizing a research article as a graph. 
Graphical representation of an article's MeSH terms is the initial step in this process. In the later work, through NLP and Semantic word theory, I'm hoping to extract relevant words (terms) from the abstract. 
This would then become beneficial, as the researcher would be able to compare two topics and contrast multiple articles through such a graph network visual approach. This by no means is to replace the researching methodology, but instead to assist in research.
