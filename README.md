## Objective

Topics Comparison MeSH Network-Graph
This web application takes two query terms. With some parameters fetches their respective PubMed records, extracts [MeSH terms](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/meshhome.html), and then builds [Network-graph](https://www.highcharts.com/blog/tutorials/network-graph/). The idea is to explore diverse or distinct topics and see what similarities they can bring forth.
